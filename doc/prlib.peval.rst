Estimators Performance Evaluation
=================================

Evaluate the performance of machine learning and recognition algorithms is foundamental for results discussion and analysis. Inside this package we collected a set of routines useful for performance estimation and parameters optimization.

Few utilities are also available in the following sub-packages:

.. toctree::

    prlib.peval.metrics
